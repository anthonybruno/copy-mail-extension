## ✨ Copy email extension

Copy email is an extension for dealing with pesky `mailto` links you accidentally click while browsing.

There's nothing worse than thinking you're going to a contact page only to click a link, and then MacOS decides to open the Mail app. This extension will instead intercept the click and copy the email address from the `mailto` link on your clipboard.

- Automatically ignores bcc, subject, etc.
- Copies directly to your clipboard
- Provides a notification when the address is successfully copied
- Supports light and dark mode
- Can turn notification off and copy email silently
