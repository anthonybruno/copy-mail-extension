## ✨ Copy email extension

Copy email is an extension for dealing with pesky `mailto` links you accidentally click while browsing. There's nothing worse than thinking you're going to a contact page only to click a link and macOS decides to open up Mail.app. This extension will instead intercept the click and copy the email address from the `mailto` link to your clipboard instead.
