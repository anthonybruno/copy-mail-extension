## Copy mailto Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that improves how mailto: links work on the web. Instead of opening your default mail app, it copies the email address directly to your clipboard so you can use it however you want.

## Why

Too many sites still use mailto: links for contact pages or “about” sections. On macOS (and elsewhere), clicking these links often triggers a default mail app you don’t even use — an annoying, disruptive experience. This extension fixes that by intercepting the click and copying the email address straight to your clipboard, letting you decide how and where to use it.
